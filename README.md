2022 solutions implemented in Swift!!

## Somewhat relevant info: 
- XCode was not used. Everything was compiled using `swiftc -o a <file.swift>`
- Example of running the executable: `./a inputfile.txt`
- Inside the template directory is a swift template program which will check for command-line arguments, (if exists) read the input file, and save its contents as a string.
